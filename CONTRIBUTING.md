# Contributing to Apache Superset PHP Client

Contributions are welcome and help make this library better for everyone.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/superset-php-client.git
   cd superset-php-client
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Make sure you have PHP 8.4 or higher installed
2. Install Composer dependencies: `composer install`

### Running Tests

Before submitting a pull request, make sure all tests pass:

```bash
# Run unit tests
composer test

# Run all tests with coverage
composer test:coverage

# Run integration tests (requires Superset instance)
composer test:integration
```

### Code Style

This project follows PSR-12 coding standards with some additional rules enforced by PHP CS Fixer.

```bash
# Check code style
composer cs-check

# Fix code style automatically
composer cs-fix
```

### Static Analysis

Currently, PHPStan is set to level 9.

```bash
composer phpstan
```

### Running All Quality Checks

Before submitting, run all quality checks:

```bash
composer quality
```

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following these guidelines:
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow PSR-12 coding standards
   - Add/update tests for your changes
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Maintain backward compatibility when possible

3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

4. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
- **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
- **Tests**: Include tests for new features or bug fixes
- **Documentation**: Update README.md if you're adding new features
- **Code Quality**: Ensure all quality checks pass (`composer quality`)
- **One Feature Per PR**: Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix
- **Single Commit**: All pull requests must contain exactly ONE commit. Use git rebase to squash multiple commits before submitting

### Squashing Commits

If you have multiple commits in your branch, you must squash them into a single commit before submitting your PR:

```bash
# Interactive rebase to squash commits (assuming you're 3 commits ahead)
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# In the editor, mark all commits except the first as 'squash' or 's'
# Save and close the editor
# Edit the final commit message
# Force push to your fork
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
# Soft reset to keep changes but remove commits
git reset --soft main
git commit -m "feat(scope): your complete change description"
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Coding Standards

### PHP

- PHP 8.4+ features are encouraged
- Use strict types: `declare(strict_types=1);`
- Use type hints for all parameters and return types
- Use readonly properties where appropriate
- Follow PSR-12 coding style
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful variable names

### Documentation

- Add PHPDoc blocks for classes and public methods
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Keep README.md up to date
- Update CHANGELOG.md for notable changes

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new code
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
feat(dashboard): add support for dashboard export

Add new method getDashboardExport() to retrieve dashboard
configuration in JSON format.

Closes #123
```
